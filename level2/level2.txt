JavaScript MA04
----------------
Level 2

1. What is the DOM?
The DOM stands for Document Object Model and is the model of the document that
forms the current webpage. If you want to access any element in an HTML page,
you always start with accessing the document object. You can use the document
object to access and manipulate HTML.




02. List three methods to manipulate the DOM.

01. Finding HTML Elements by Tag Name :
document.getElementsByTagName ();

02. Finding HTML Elements by CSS Selectors :
document.querySelectorAll ();

03. Finding HTML Element by Id :
document.getElementById ();




03. What is an asynchronous call?
With an asynchronous call you can do multiple things at a time. Your call will
be sent to a queue and pushed up to the call stack when the call stack is empty.




04. Briefly explain what the sources tab in Chromes Developers Tools does.
The sources tab in Chromes Developers Tools allows you to open your files
so you can debug your code. Here you can set breakpoints so you can go into your
code, step over functions, step into functions or step out of functions.




05. What is a JavaScript promise?
A JavaScript promise is a way to execute code asynchronously, which means that
when we call a promise our code doesn´t wait for a response, but moves on to the
next line of code. A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or
fail twice, neither can it switch from success to failure or vice versa.

A promise can be :
01. Fulfilled; The action relating to the promise succeeded.
02. Rejected; The action relating to the promise failed.
03. Pending; Hasn´t fulfilled or rejected yet.
04. Settled; Has fulfilled or rejected.




06. What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) provides a way to communicate with
other software.




07. What is a JavaScript Event?
JavaScript´s interaction with HTML is handled through events.
A JavaScript event is when an event is triggered either by the browser or when a
user interacts with an element on a webpage. When these events are fired off,
JavaScript allows us to do something. Examples of events; When the page loads,
when the user clicks the mouse over a certain element or hovers the cursor over
a certain element, a form being submitted, pressing any key, closing a window or resizing a
window, a video being played, paused or finished playing or an error occurring.




08. What is event bubbling?
Events can bubble up to its parent´s events, fire off unwanted events and
applications will become unstable.
A click on an image does not only generate a click event for the corresponding
IMG element, but also for the parent A, for the grandfather LI and so on, going
all the way up through all the element´s ancestors, before terminating at the
window object. You can stop the event bubbling by using the stopPropagation method.
